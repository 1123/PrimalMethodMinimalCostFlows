# PrimalMethodMinimalCostFlows
A Scala Implementation of the algorithms described in the paper "A Primal Method for Minimal Cost Flows with Applications to the Assignment and Transportation Problems" by Morton Klein .

The above mentioned paper provides a solution to the [Minimum Cost Flow Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-cost_flow_problem) 
  as well as to the Mimimum Cost Max Flow Problem. 
This project provides a Scala implementation of the algorithms described therein. 
It also includes an implementation of the Ford/Fulkerson algorithm for finding a maximum cost flow.
